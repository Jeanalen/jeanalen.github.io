	 <p> I am hard-working and collaborative about my school works as a student. <br>
	 I'm Jeanalen Tabaranza. I love reading and writing spoken poetry.  <br>
	 I feel good about this school and I just hope to make some good friends there  <br>
	 because I am a new student here at University of Bohol after transferring there  <br>
	 from my former school, BIT INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE. <br>
	 I have extraordinary skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in the few.  <br>
	 Life should be enjoyed to the fullest and with the intention of improving the lives of others. <br>
	 I've always wanted to help my people in any way I can, keeping this goal in mind. </p>
	 
	 <h2> GUIDING PRINCIPLE </h2>
	 <p> Embrace disappointments. Many people make an effort to prevent being disappointed. <br>
	 They form a resentful bond with disappointment. However, disappointment is a natural part <br>
	 of being human because it reveals your true interests. Instead of fighting it, accept it. <br>
	 To produce more in life, first comprehend it and then channel into it. </p>
	 
	  <h2> DIFFERENT FROM OTHER?  </h2>
	  <p> Although everyone is unique in their own way, some traits including a distinctive personality,  <br>
	  interests, and talents can help someone stand out from the crowd. People may also differ from one  <br>
	  another due to their experiences in life or how they were raised. If I may, what makes me different  <br>
	  is that I have special ways to enhance my skills and talents, even though I haven't fully represented   <br>
	  some of them. I'm so proud of who I am today and what I've accomplished. Just remember that only you  <br>
	  can be proud of your accomplishments; you must have made great sacrifices in order to achieve your  <br>
	  life's specific goals. </p>
	  
	  <h2> ACCOMPLISHMENTS  </h2>
	  <p> The fact that all of my high school effort finally paid off better than I anticipated is another aspect <br>
	  of my accomplishments that I value the most. I'm currently enrolled in University of Bohol, where my journey <br>
	  toward my goals began. I faced some difficulties even if a lot of things went smoothly because I was accepted to <br>
	  the University of Bohol. I've found that looking back on my academic career really helps me identify the areas where  <br>
	  I need to put in more effort if I want to succeed in college. I want to especially thank God for always <br>
	  directing my plans life's specific goals. </p>
	  
	  
	  <h2> DREAMS AND FUTURE PLANS  </h2>
	  <p> Everyone has goals for their future. Man's inner aspiration is called an aim or an ambition. <br>
	  Without a goal, no man and woman can do anything in this life. So, each of us needs to be extremely <br>
	  clear about what we want to achieve in life. As of now my only ambition in life is to finish and focus on my <br>
	  study to have a degree in the future. I want my family and peers to be proud of what I'm going to achieve. <br>
	  I also want to achieve a career that can support my family and to those who supported me right now. </p>
